# Kempeth's Auto Map Pin Mod for Valheim
This mod serves as a kind of "radar" for your Valheim map, automatically creating temporary pins for various ingame objects. Currently supported categories are:

* **Mineables:** Copper, Tin, Iron, Silver, Obsidian, Meteorites and Leviathans
* **Dungeons:** Burial Chambers, Troll Caves, Sunken Crypts, Mountain Caves and Infested Mines
* **Seeds:** Carrot Seeds, Turnip Seeds, Barley and Flax
* **Harvestables:** Berries, Mushrooms, Remains and many more
* **Flowers:** Dandelions and Thistles (separate because they really fill up the map when enabled and are generally easy to find)

Most type of markers will group multiple objects of the same time into a single pin (Berries Mushrooms, Flax, Barley, and such) to reduce clutter on the map.

Copper, Iron and Silver will show whether they are fully intact or partially mined.

Each category has it's own icon and can be enabled and disabled via the **BepInEx ModConfiguration** plugin. In addition you can also toggle the display of all object types that I've currently identified in the game. But be warned that this will really clutter your map.

##  Planned Features
* Pins for Points of Interests like ruins, stone circles and camps
